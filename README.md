# Handwritten Digit Recognition (Binary Classification)

Welcome to my **Handwritten Digit Recognition** project!  
In this project, I build and train a **Neural Network** model that can recognize handwritten digits — specifically classify whether an input image is a **"0"** or **"Not 0"**.

This repository contains:
- **Implementation using TensorFlow & Keras** (industry-standard libraries)
- **Implementation from Scratch** (no libraries for modeling — every function manually coded)

Both versions show a deep understanding of Neural Networks and Machine Learning fundamentals.

## The goal of this project is to:

- Build a machine learning model that can **classify images of handwritten digits** into two categories:  
  ➔ **0** or **Not 0**.
- Understand, build, and optimize a **Neural Network** both **with frameworks** and **from scratch**.
- Demonstrate skills in **Deep Learning**, **Data Processing**, **Model Evaluation**, and **Visualization**.
- Showcase ability to build industry-grade and academic-level solutions.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- (Scratch Version: Pure Python without high-level ML libraries)

---

## Model Overview

- **Input**: 28×28 pixel grayscale images (flattened to 784 features)
- **Architecture**: Simple feedforward neural network (Dense layers)
- **Activation Functions**: ReLU, Sigmoid
- **Loss Function**: Binary Crossentropy
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy
- **Dataset**: MNIST dataset (from sklearn.datasets)

---

## Results

- **Achieved high training and validation accuracy**
- **Visualized Loss vs Accuracy graphs**
- **Avoided overfitting using proper data splits**

Both implementations — TensorFlow and scratch — gave comparable results, proving that the logic holds in both cases.
